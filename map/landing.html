  <h4>WSP Eco Projects (formerly WSP Ecology)</h4>
  
  WSP Eco Projects is an environmental initiative to celebrate the wild things of the park. 

  <p>The first project is WSP Eco Map, a mobile map of the trees in the park, the historic flow and contemporary route of the channelized Minetta Brook/Creek, and other environmental assets in the park such as nesting boxes. Local Ecology partnered with the Washington Square Park Blog to raise money to hire a map developer. Thirty five donors gave $3,050 to the campaign which was hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ioby.org/">ioby.org</a>.
  </p>

  <p>WSP Eco Projects also provides experiential learning opportunities in the park. Three events were offered in 2014: (1) a plant photography workshop taught by local photographer Hubert J. Steed; (2) a nature scavenger hunt co-designed with Julie Cramer, a NYU Conservation Education graduate student; and (3) a fall foliage tree walk led by urban naturalist Leslie Day, PhD.
